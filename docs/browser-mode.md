# Browser Mode

`oracle --engine browser` routes the assembled prompt bundle through the ChatGPT web UI instead of the Responses API. (Legacy `--browser` still maps to `--engine browser`, but it will be removed.) If you omit `--engine`, Oracle first honors any `engine` value in `~/.oracle/config.json`, then auto-picks API when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is available and falls back to browser otherwise. The CLI writes the same session metadata/logs as API runs, but the payload is pasted into ChatGPT via a temporary Chrome profile.

`--preview` now works with `--engine browser`: it renders the composed prompt, lists which files would be uploaded vs inlined, and shows the bundle location when bundling is enabled, without launching Chrome.

## Current Pipeline

1. **Prompt assembly** – we reuse the normal prompt builder (`buildPrompt`) and the markdown renderer. Browser mode pastes the system + user text (no special markers) into the ChatGPT composer and then uploads each resolved `--file` individually (via the hidden `<input type="file">`) before submitting the prompt.
2. **Automation stack** – code lives in `src/browserMode.ts` and is a lightly refactored version of the `oraclecheap` utility:
   - Launches Chrome via `chrome-launcher` and connects with `chrome-remote-interface`.
   - (Optional) copies cookies from the requested browser profile via Oracle’s built-in cookie reader (Keychain/DPAPI aware) so you stay signed in.
   - Navigates to `chatgpt.com`, switches the model (currently just label-matching for GPT-5.1/GPT-5 Pro), pastes the prompt, waits for completion, and copies the markdown via the built-in “copy turn” button.
   - When files are queued, we upload them one-by-one via the hidden `<input type="file">` and wait for ChatGPT to re-enable the send button before submitting the combined system+user prompt.
   - Cleans up the temporary profile unless `--browser-keep-browser` is passed.
3. **Session integration** – browser sessions use the normal log writer, add `mode: "browser"` plus `browser.config/runtime` metadata, and log the Chrome PID/port so `oracle session <id>` (or `oracle status <id>`) shows a marker for the background Chrome process.
4. **Usage accounting** – we estimate input tokens with the same tokenizer used for API runs and estimate output tokens via `estimateTokenCount`. `oracle status` therefore shows comparable cost/timing info even though the call ran through the browser.

### CLI Options

- `--engine browser`: enables browser mode (legacy `--browser` remains as an alias for now). Without `--engine`, Oracle chooses API when `OPENAI_API_KEY` exists, otherwise browser.
- `--browser-chrome-profile`, `--browser-chrome-path`: cookie source + binary override (defaults to the standard `"Default"` Chrome profile so existing ChatGPT logins carry over).
- `--browser-cookie-path`: explicit path to the Chrome/Chromium/Edge `Cookies` SQLite DB. Handy when you launch a fork via `--browser-chrome-path` and want to copy its session cookies; see [docs/chromium-forks.md](chromium-forks.md) for examples.
- `--browser-timeout`, `--browser-input-timeout`: `1200s (20m)`/`30s` defaults. Durations accept `ms`, `s`, `m`, or `h` and can be chained (`1h2m10s`).
- `--browser-no-cookie-sync`, `--browser-headless`, `--browser-hide-window`, `--browser-keep-browser`, and the global `-v/--verbose` flag for detailed automation logs.
- `--browser-url`: override ChatGPT base URL if needed.
- `--browser-inline-files`: paste resolved files directly into the composer instead of uploading them (debug fallback; useful when the attachment button is broken).
- `--browser-bundle-files`: bundle all resolved attachments into a single temp file before uploading (useful when you want one upload even with many files).
- sqlite bindings: automatic rebuilds now require `ORACLE_ALLOW_SQLITE_REBUILD=1`. Without it, the CLI logs instructions instead of running `pnpm rebuild` on your behalf.
- `--model`: the same flag used for API runs controls the ChatGPT picker. Pass descriptive labels such as `--model "ChatGPT 5.1 Instant"` when you want a specific browser variant; canonical API names (`gpt-5.1-pro`, `gpt-5.1`) still work and map to their default picker labels (legacy `gpt-5-pro` remains supported).
- Cookie sync is mandatory—if we can’t copy cookies from Chrome, the run exits early. Use the hidden `--browser-allow-cookie-errors` flag only when you’re intentionally running logged out (it skips the early exit but still warns).
- Experimental cookie controls (hidden flags/env):
  - `--browser-cookie-names <comma-list>` or `ORACLE_BROWSER_COOKIE_NAMES`: allowlist which cookies to sync. Useful for “only NextAuth/Cloudflare, drop the rest.”
  - `--browser-inline-cookies <jsonOrBase64>` or `ORACLE_BROWSER_COOKIES_JSON`: skip Chrome/keychain and set cookies directly. Payload is a JSON array of DevTools `CookieParam` objects (or the same, base64-encoded). At minimum you need `name`, `value`, and either `url` or `domain`; we infer `path=/`, `secure=true`, `httpOnly=false`.
  - `--browser-inline-cookies-file <path>` or `ORACLE_BROWSER_COOKIES_FILE`: load the same payload from disk (JSON or base64 JSON). If no args/env are provided, Oracle also auto-loads `~/.oracle/cookies.json` or `~/.oracle/cookies.base64` when present.
  - Practical minimal set that keeps ChatGPT logged in and avoids the workspace picker: `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` (include `.0`/`.1` variants) and `_account` (active workspace/account). Cloudflare proofs (`cf_clearance`, `__cf_bm`/`_cfuvid`/`CF_Authorization`/`__cflb`) are only needed when a challenge is active. In practice our allowlist pulls just two cookies (session token + `_account`) and works; add the Cloudflare names if you hit a challenge.
  - Inline payload shape example (we ignore extra fields like `expirationDate`, `sameSite`, `hostOnly`):  
    ```json
    [
      { "name": "__Secure-next-auth.session-token", "value": "<token>", "domain": "chatgpt.com", "path": "/", "secure": true, "httpOnly": true, "expires": 1771295753 },
      { "name": "_account", "value": "personal", "domain": "chatgpt.com", "path": "/", "secure": true, "httpOnly": false, "expires": 1770702447 }
    ]
    ```

All options are persisted with the session so reruns (`oracle exec <id>`) reuse the same automation settings.

## Remote Chrome Sessions (headless/server workflows)

Oracle can reuse an already-running Chrome/Edge instance on another machine by tunneling over the Chrome DevTools Protocol. This is handy when:

- Your CLI runs on a headless server (Linux/macOS CI, remote mac minis, etc.) but you want the browser UI to live on a desktop where you can see uploads or respond to Captcha challenges.
- You want to keep a single signed-in profile open (e.g., Windows VM with company SSO) while sending prompts from other hosts.

### 1. Start Chrome with remote debugging enabled

On the machine that should host the browser window:

```bash
google-chrome \
  --remote-debugging-port=9222 \
  --remote-debugging-address=0.0.0.0 \
  --user-data-dir=/path/to/profile \
  --profile-directory='Default'
```

Notes:

- Any Chromium flavor works (Chrome, Edge, Vivaldi, etc.)—just ensure CDP is exposed on a reachable host:port. Linux distributions often call the binary `google-chrome-stable`. On macOS you can run `/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome`.
- `--remote-debugging-address=0.0.0.0` is required if the CLI connects from another machine. Lock it down behind a VPN or SSH tunnel if the network is untrusted.
- Keep this browser window open and signed into ChatGPT; Oracle will reuse that session and **will not** copy cookies over the wire.

### 2. Point Oracle at the remote browser

From the machine running `oracle`:

```bash
oracle --engine browser \
  --remote-chrome 192.168.1.10:9222 \
  --prompt "Summarize the latest incident doc" \
  --file docs/incidents/latest.md
```

Key behavior:

- Use IPv6 by wrapping the host in brackets, e.g. `--remote-chrome "[2001:db8::1]:9222"`.
- Local-only flags like `--browser-headless`, `--browser-hide-window`, `--browser-keep-browser`, and `--browser-chrome-path` are ignored because Oracle no longer launches Chrome. You still get verbose logging, model switching, attachment uploads, and markdown capture.
- Cookie sync is skipped automatically (the remote browser already has cookies). If you need inline cookies, use them on the machine that’s actually running Chrome.
- Attachments are transferred via CDP: Oracle reads each file locally, base64-encodes it, and uses `DataTransfer` inside the remote browser to populate the upload field. Files larger than 20 MB are rejected to keep CDP messages reasonable.
- When the remote WebSocket disconnects, Oracle errors with “Remote Chrome connection lost…” so you can re-run after restarting the browser.

### 3. Troubleshooting

- Run `scripts/test-remote-chrome.ts <host> [port]` to sanity-check connectivity (`npx tsx scripts/test-remote-chrome.ts my-host 9222`).
- If you target IPv6 without brackets (e.g., `2001:db8::1:9222`), the CLI rejects it—wrap the address like `[2001:db8::1]:9222`.
- Ensure firewalls allow inbound TCP to the debugging port and that you’re not behind a captive proxy stripping WebSocket upgrades.
- Because we do not control the remote lifecycle, Chrome stays running after the session. Shut it down manually when you’re done or remove `--remote-debugging-port` to stop exposing CDP.

### Remote Service Mode (`oracle serve`)

Prefer to keep Chrome entirely on the remote Mac (no DevTools tunneling, no manual cookie shuffling)? Use the built-in service:

1. **Start the host**
   ```bash
   oracle serve
   ```
   Oracle picks a free port, launches Chrome, starts an HTTP/SSE API, and prints:
   ```
   Remote Oracle listening at 0.0.0.0:9473
   Access token: c4e5f9...
   ```
   Use `--host`, `--port`, or `--token` to override the defaults if needed.

2. **Run from your laptop**
   ```bash
   oracle --engine browser \
     --remote-host 192.168.64.2:9473 \
     --remote-token c4e5f9... \
     --remote-cookie-source local \
     --prompt "Summarize the incident doc" \
     --file docs/incidents/latest.md
   ```
   - `--remote-host` points the CLI at the VM.
   - `--remote-token` matches the token printed by `oracle serve` (set `ORACLE_REMOTE_TOKEN` to avoid repeating it).
   - `--remote-cookie-source local` (optional) exports your local Chrome cookies and ships them to the remote host so the remote Chrome session stays signed in. Use `none` when the VM already has an active ChatGPT session.

3. **What happens**
   - The CLI assembles the composed prompt + file bundle locally, sends them (plus cookies if requested) to the VM, and streams log lines/answer text back through the same HTTP connection.
   - The remote host runs Chrome locally, so uploads, model switching, and markdown capture all happen on the VM. Your machine simply prints the logs.
   - Background/detached sessions (`--no-wait`) are disabled in remote mode so the CLI can keep streaming output.

4. **Stop the host**
   - `Ctrl+C` on the VM shuts down the HTTP server and Chrome. Restart `oracle serve` whenever you need a new session; omit `--token` to let it rotate automatically.

This mode is ideal when you have a macOS VM (or spare Mac mini) logged into ChatGPT and you just want to run the CLI from another machine without ever copying profiles or keeping Chrome visible locally.

## Limitations / Follow-Up Plan

- **Attachment lifecycle** – every `--file` path is uploaded separately so ChatGPT can ingest the original filenames/content. The automation waits for the uploads to finish (send button enabled, no upload indicators) before hitting submit. Follow-up work: expose upload status in session logs. When upload automation flakes, use `--browser-inline-files` to fall back to pasting file contents directly.
- **Model picker drift** – we currently rely on heuristics to pick GPT-5.1/GPT-5 Pro. If OpenAI changes the DOM we need to refresh the selectors quickly. Consider snapshot tests or a small “self check” command.
- **Non-mac platforms** – window hiding uses AppleScript today; Linux/Windows just ignore the flag. We should detect platforms explicitly and document the behavior.
- **Streaming UX** – browser runs cannot stream tokens, so we log a warning before launching Chrome. Investigate whether we can stream clipboard deltas via mutation observers for a closer UX.

## Testing Notes

- `pnpm test --filter browser` does not exist yet; manual runs with `--engine browser -v` are the current validation path.
- Most of the heavy lifting lives in `src/browserMode.ts`. If you change selectors or the mutation observer logic, run a local `oracle --engine browser --browser-keep-browser` session so you can inspect DevTools before cleanup.
